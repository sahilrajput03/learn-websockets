# learn websockets

```bash
# Install WebSockets npm library
npm i ws
```

`ws` library is good and is actually a low level building block but when it comes to real world problems like chat rooms and others its better to use `socket.io` as its made to solve problems like that.

FYI: `Firebase`, `apollo`, `pusher` are other realtime communication problem solvers as well.
